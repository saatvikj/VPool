	Main runner function that initializes the graph, 
	assigns weights to vertices, applies all algorithms 
	to it and obtains response for the given data.
	
	Args:
		filename: Full path of file containing data.

		option: Parameter to specify the type of data,
		1 for pickled data, 2 for csv data.

		text_output: The output text file used to communicate
		with jsprit java code (Default: vehicle_statistics.txt).

		output (optional): Full path of where to save 
		the graph and generated data for later, it is
		only used if data needs to be saved for later.

		time_start (optional): Start time to query the
		input dataset for data, it is only needed for
		querying the dataset when input type is CSV.

		time_end (optional): End time to query the input
		dataset for data, it is only needed for
		querying the dataset when input type is CSV.

		port (optional): The full link to localhost port 
		on which osrm server is running, it is only needed
		for generating the distances between points after
		dataset is queried when input type is CSV.

		delta (optional): The tolerance value used for
		admissibility, it is only used to create the graph
		when tolerance levels are required to decide 
		admissibility when input type is CSV. 

		size_limit (optional): The upper bound on number 
		of objects that will be created from the riders,
		used only to categorize data on the basis of 
		input size.

	Returns:
		A list of statistics corresponding to the algorithm
		applied on input/queried data with both WVC and
		standard coloring in the coloring phase.
