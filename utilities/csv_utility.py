	Utility function to read content present in csv
	file written in NYC data format and put into 
	corresponding files.

	Args:
		csv_file_name: Path of csv file containing
		data

		time_start: Start time to query the input
		dataset for data.

		time_end: End time to query the input dataset
		for data.

		port: The full link to localhost port on which
		osrm server is running.

		delta: The tolerance value used for admissibility.

		size_limit: The upper bound on number of objects
		that will be created from the riders, used only
		to categorize data on the basis of input size.

	Returns:
		Adjacency matrix, distance from destinations,
		distance between sources, distance between
		destinations, distance between source destination
		pairs and list of request objects.
